Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming 
language that is designed to have 
as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is a general-purpose programming language 
intended to let application developers write once, 
run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java 
code can run on all platforms that support Java 
without the need for recompilation.[17] Java 
applications are typically compiled to bytecode 
that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has 
fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
